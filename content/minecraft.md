#Skyenet SMP Minecraft Server
I host a small Minecraft server at this URL, if you want access message me on Telegram or Discord (Pretzel 🏳🌈#0001)  
  
There are a couple of rules:
1. No griefing
2. No harassment
3. No homophobia, sexism, transphobia, etc
4. No spam  

These rules can really be simplified as "Don't be a dick"
