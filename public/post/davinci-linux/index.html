      <p>Let me just start this post with this: oh god</p>

<p>I wanted to run Davinci Resolve on my Arch Linux PC to do some video editing for a school project. Now you&rsquo;re probably saying &ldquo;Just use OpenShot, Kdenlive, or even Blender&rdquo; and while yes that can edit, they&rsquo;re not stable for me and are missing some features that I need/would like to have.
So I decided to use Davinci Resolve, problem is that I <em>never</em> got it to work before. I mean <strong><em>never</em></strong>.
On Ubuntu, Fedora, or Arch Linux. Yet other people could run it fine on these systems. Still, I <em>really</em> wanted to run Davinci Resolve and figure out why it wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>I started out by using the AUR package <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/davinci-resolve-beta/">davinci-resolve-beta</a>
Yet it didn&rsquo;t work, it threw an error about OpenCL and how none of my card support it. This was confusing because my GPU (An R9 380) worked with Davinci on <em>Windows</em>  and when I googled this error, it was filled with people having issue with their Intel iGPU. (Yes my iGPU was disabled.)
I then tried checking if opencl-mesa was installed, it wasn&rsquo;t. So I then thought to myself &ldquo;Ah ha, OpenCL isn&rsquo;t actually <em>installed</em>&rdquo;. I went ahead and installed it, <em>annnnd</em> it still crashed. Giving me the same error.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m stuck here, thinking to myself &ldquo;Is my card blacklisted on Linux? Does it just not work at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, I decided to check the logs more deeply. (Lesson of the day BTW)</p>

<p>I find this &ldquo;| INFO  | 2019-04-29 17:09:01,894 | Skipping unqualified OpenCL platform: Clover&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clover isn&rsquo;t the name of my generation&rsquo;s card name? Where could it be getting that name from?
Turns out Mesa&rsquo;s OpenCL is called Clover and Davinci Resolve doesn&rsquo;t work with the open source drivers.</p>

<p>I go install [opencl-amd](), a version of the OpenCL included with AMDGPU-PRO drivers but made to work with the open source AMDGPU drivers.</p>

<p>I try to open Davinci Resolve and IT FINDS MY CARD, but it doesn&rsquo;t open? Still stuck in the same place?
Turns out it&rsquo;s still trying to load the Mesa OpenCL so I go ahead and uninstall that.</p>

<p>I open it&hellip; AND PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE. IT GETS PAST LOOKING FOR CONTROL SURFACES AND MORE STUFF APPEARS IN THE LOG.
IT STILL CRASHES BUT I SEE [THIS](), A PROBLEM REPORT FOR DAVINCI RESOLVE. A WINDOW HAS BEEN OPENED.</p>

<p>At this point it crashes around loading the fairlight ui and oh lord I made the mistake of clicking &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Show Me Again&rdquo;</p>

<p>Time to reinstall DaVinci Resolve and hope it resets my user settings.
OH BUT IT DOESN&rsquo;T BECAUSE IN THE INSTALLER LOG I SEE &ldquo;/var/BlackmagicDesign/DaVinci Resolve&rdquo;
YAY, atleast I found what to delete. Of course, deleting that doesn&rsquo;t work.
At this point this is my 5th reinstall.
Can you guess what happened? That&rsquo;s right NOTHING HAPPENED!</p>

<p>Looking on the fourms, you appearently need an intel iGPU to help you run it. /shrug I have no idea what it means by this.
So I decided to enable my iGPU in my BIOS.</p>

<p>TLDR:
Install opencl-amd and uninstall opencl-mesa if trying to use DaVinci Resolve on a machine with an AMD graphics card.</p>
